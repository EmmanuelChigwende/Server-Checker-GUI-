# Server-Checker-GUI-

this is a simple gui interface for a python server checker i made it`s not really that impressive by then again i made it , yeah also feel free to change anything in the code , as fpr the server checker itself is a python script that i will include in the code feel free to try and com=nnec the code to the gui because the way the gui currenlty works is you imput the server checker results manually 

please note that this api was connected to a local mongo database 
to ensure it properly works just setup a local database
